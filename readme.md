# General information

Pre-config Django with django-rest-framework, corsheaders, user-profile model and autentication process (Login, Signup, Password reset, password, recovery...).

And it has a pre-configured [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for develoment too.

There is a docker-compose for production, an another for development.

## Installation

Use the git clone command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linkcharsoft/async-django-docker-boilerplate
cd django-docker-boilerplate
```

Create and complete a .env file with your app info (there is already a .env.example file).
In order to complete the "SECRET_KEY" field, you can use the default on .env.example but then you must run the following command and copy the given value on the .env file:
```bash
python manage.py get_secret_key
```


Then for development run:
```bash
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Or for production run:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml build
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d
```
